Contains code for the tasks given to me by Null Class as assignments.

Different Tasks that was given to me ->

1. Visualize Activation Maps: Description: Visualize activation maps to understand which image regions activate CNN filters for age detection. Guidelines: You can use any of your pre trained model (made by you) for this task. GUI is not necessary for this task.

2. Senior citizen Identification: Description: In this task, you will develop a machine learning model to predict multiple persons in a video or real-time webcam feed for a mall or local store. Your model should detect their age and gender. If a person’s age is more than 60, mark them as a senior citizen and detect their gender. After detection, store the age, gender, and time of visit in an Excel or CSV file. Guidelines: Create your own machine learning model for this task. While a graphical user interface (GUI) is not mandatory, you are welcome to include one if you wish. Although accuracy is important, we will evaluate your work based on the overall performance of your model and the successful functionality of your GUI.

3. Age and Emotion Detection through voice: Description: In this task, you will develop a machine learning model to detect a person’s age from a voice note. The model should only process male voices; if a female voice is detected, it should reject the input and display a message saying, “Upload male voice.” If the person’s age is more than 60, the model should mark them as a senior citizen and detect their emotion. For individuals below 60, the model should only detect their age. Guidelines: This task is designed to test your logic-building and problem-solving skills. We encourage you to embrace the challenge and view it as an opportunity to grow. Please create your own machine learning model and ensure it includes a graphical user interface (GUI). While accuracy is important, we will evaluate your work based on the overall performance of your model and the successful functionality of your GUI.

4. Long Hair Identification: Description: In this task, you will develop a feature to detect a person with long hair as female, even if they are male, and detect a short-haired female as male, even if they are female. The model should work exclusively for individuals aged between 20 and 30. If an image of a person outside this age range (below 20 or above 30) is uploaded, the model should correctly predict their gender regardless of hair length. Guidelines: This task is designed to test your logic-building and problem-solving skills. We encourage you to embrace the challenge and view it as an opportunity to grow. Please create your own machine learning model and ensure it includes a graphical user interface (GUI). While accuracy is important, we will evaluate your work based on the overall performance of your model and the successful functionality of your GUI. Good luck and enjoy the process!

5. Nationality Detection Model: Description: In this task, you will develop a machine learning model to predict the nationality of a person by uploading their image and predict their emotion. If the person’s nationality is Indian, the model should additionally predict their age and dress colour along with emotions. For individuals from the United States, the model should predict only their age and emotions. For African individuals, the model should predict their emotion and dress colour. For other nationalities, the model should predict only their nationality and emotions. Guidelines: You should have a proper GUI with preview of the input images. Also have an output section to show the results.

6. Age Detection for Horror Roller Coaster: Description: In this task, you will develop a machine learning model for real-time age detection on a horror roller coaster. The model should detect the age and gender of people. If the age is less than 13 or greater than 60, the model should display a message saying, “Not allowed” and mark them with a red rectangle. Additionally, the model should store all data, including age, gender, and entry time, in an Excel or CSV file. Guidelines: Create your own machine learning model for this task. While a graphical user interface (GUI) is not mandatory, you are welcome to include one if you wish. Although accuracy is important, we will evaluate your work based on the overall performance of your model and the successful functionality of your GUI.

7. Sign Language Detection: Description: In this task, you will train a machine learning model to predict sign language and recognize some known words of your choice. The model should be operational during a specific time period, such as from 6 PM to 10 PM. Guidelines: You should have a proper GUI with features for both upload image and real time video.

Different tasks are sorted in their respective folder. The '.ipynb' file is run on a kaggle environment, '.py' files are run locally.
".h5" files are the model while ".weights.h5" files are the model weights.
